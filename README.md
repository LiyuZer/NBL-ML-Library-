Neural Network Library
Overview
This neural network library is crafted to enable the creation and optimization of any computational node structure, delivering the intended output with efficiency. It's designed with flexibility in mind, allowing users to build and tailor their neural network models to specific requirements.

Key Features
Dynamic Tree for Automatic Differentiation: At the heart of this library is a dynamic tree structure that facilitates automatic differentiation. This feature is crucial for optimizing neural network training, making the calculation of gradients both accurate and efficient.

Pre-Made Layers: To streamline the development process, the library includes pre-made layers such as convolution and feed-forward layers. These are optimized for single-threaded environments and do not require GPU support, making the library accessible for a wide range of users and systems.

Non-GPU Optimization: Understanding the resource constraints in various environments, this library is finely tuned for optimal performance on non-GPU systems, ensuring high efficiency even in single-thread environments.
